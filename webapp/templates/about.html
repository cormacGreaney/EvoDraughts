        <h2>What is EvoDraughts?</h2>
        <p>
            EvoDraughts is my Final Year Project where I'm using <strong>Grammatical Evolution (GE)</strong> to evolve 
            draughts strategies. I built this using the GRAPE framework (Grammatical Algorithms in Python for Evolution) which lets me 
            evolve AI strategies through genetic algorithms instead of manually programming them.

                    <h3>Grammar Definition</h3>
                    <p>I wrote a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar that defines how strategies can be built. This includes 
                    things like conditional statements, math operations, and ways to check board features. Each strategy 
                    is basically a program written in this grammar.</p>

                    <h3>Evolution Process</h3>
                    <p>I start with a population of random strategies and let them evolve over generations. Each strategy 
                    plays games against random opponents, and I measure their fitness based on how many games they win. 
                    The ones that perform better are more likely to survive and reproduce.</p>

                    <h3>Strategy Selection</h3>
                    <p>I use genetic algorithm operations - selection, crossover (combining two strategies), and mutation 
                    (randomly changing parts). Over many generations, the strategies get better at playing draughts. I've 
                    seen strategies go from random moves to actually making decent decisions.</p>

                    <p>This web app lets people play against the evolved strategies. It's really useful for me to see how 
                    they perform against human players, not just random opponents. Plus it makes the project more interactive 
                    and fun for testing.</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <div class="tech-grid">
            <div class="tech-item">
                <h3>Grammatical Evolution</h3>
                <p>This is a type of genetic programming where I represent strategies as binary strings that get mapped 
                to valid expressions through my grammar. It's cool because it guarantees the strategies are always syntactically 
                correct.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-item">
                <h3>GRAPE Framework</h3>
                <p>I'm using the GRAPE Python framework which handles a lot of the grammatical evolution mechanics for me. 
                It takes care of turning binary genomes into phenotypes (the actual strategy expressions) and manages the 
                evolution process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-item">
                <h3>Board Representation</h3>
                <p>When a strategy needs to evaluate a position, it gets access to board features like piece positions, 
                how many pieces each player has, king counts, mobility (available moves), and center control. The strategy 
                uses these to decide what move to make.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-item">
                <h3>Fitness Evaluation</h3>
                <p>I evaluate each strategy by having it play multiple games against random opponents. The fitness score 
                is based on how many games it wins. Lower fitness means better performance (I'm minimizing losses). I also 
                add a small penalty for overly simple strategies to encourage complexity.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Difficulty Levels</h2>
        <p>I've organized the strategies into three difficulty levels by manually assigning specific evolved strategies to each level:</p>
        <ul class="difficulty-list">
            <li><strong>Easy:</strong> Strategies that are easier to play against, good if you're just learning or want a casual game.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Strategies that offer a balanced challenge for intermediate players.</li>
            <li><strong>Hard:</strong> The strongest evolved strategies that should give experienced players a decent challenge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rather than automatically categorizing strategies based on fitness scores, I manually selected and assigned specific strategy files to each difficulty level. This allows me to ensure a better gameplay experience and properly test strategies based on their actual performance against human players.</p>

        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>
            This is my Final Year Project at the University of Limerick. I chose to explore evolutionary computation applied 
            to game AI because I find it fascinating that you can evolve strategies instead of hand-coding them. It's been 
            really interesting to watch the strategies improve over generations and see what kinds of patterns they develop.
