        <p class="intro-text">
            This is my Final Year Project where I'm using <strong>Grammatical Evolution (GE)</strong> with the GRAPE framework 
            to evolve draughts playing strategies. I've trained AI opponents through genetic algorithms, and you can 
            test them out here. The strategies improve over generations by playing games and learning what works.

                <p>I've organized the evolved strategies into Easy, Medium, and Hard categories based on how well they perform. Each represents different stages of the evolution process.</p>

                <h3>Board Size Options</h3>
                <p>You can choose between a simplified 6x6 board for quicker games, or the full 8x8 standard draughts board for the traditional experience.</p>

                <h3>Evolved Strategies</h3>
                <p>All the AI opponents you'll face are strategies that evolved through my grammatical evolution system, not pre-programmed rules.</p>

                <p>Play real games with visual feedback. The AI will make its moves automatically after yours, and you can see exactly what's happening.</p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            For my Final Year Project, I wanted to explore how <strong>Grammatical Evolution</strong> could be applied to game AI. 
            The strategies are written as expressions using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar, and then evolved over generations 
            using genetic algorithms. Each generation plays games, and the better strategies are selected to create the next generation.
