Project Title: EvoGame: Evolving Game Strategies Using GE
Project Category: Predominately Research
Project Description: This project focuses on creating a system where game strategies for a
simple turn-based game (e.g., Connect Four, draughts, or a custom-designed game) are
evolved using GE. The project will involve defining a grammar that specifies possible moves
and tactics and then using grammatical evolution to iteratively improve these strategies. By
simulating thousands of games, the evolved strategies can be tested and refined to find the
optimal approach.
Objectives:
1. Develop a system that evolves strategies for a turn-based game using grammatical
evolution.
2. Implement and optimize a grammar that defines possible game strategies.
3. Analyse and visualize the evolution of strategies over multiple generations
